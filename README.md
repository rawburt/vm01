# vm01

A minimal interpreted stack oriented programming language inspired by assembly and FORTH. The main goal with this project was to make enough primitives to create a random number guessing game. This game can be found in `examples` directory. After that, I solved some Project Euler problems and decided I was done with this project. The Project Euler solutions can be found in `examples/euler` directory.
